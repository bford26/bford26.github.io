This project was started during the fall of 2019. Motivation for this build mainly came from the desire to challenge my fine wood working. My previous projects have honed my skills with large projects: bookselves and desks.

## Project Build Process

* Research
  * By far longest part of the build because I had no prior knowledge of guitar designs and construction.

* Design
  * Heavily influenced by build standards and other guitar designs
  * Determing fret count, scale size, type of guitar(active or passive), 

* Materials
  * My background in woodworking made the choice of materials for the body, neck, and fret board simple
  * But for the hardware I was clueless, and had to rely on my research and local advise from expereience guitar repairman.

* Construction
  * Rough Shaping for dimensions
    * clean up faces for pieces of body for lamination
    * routing neck for truss rods
    * angle on fretbaord
  * Lamination of body 
  * Fine shaping only for body and neck fit
    * lots of scribing and detailing, because no template
    * routing neck hole -> error -> chisel work and inlay
    * routing pickup holes and electronics cavity
  * making custom back plate for secure body to neck connection
  * installing bridge and ensuring a properly aligned neck to body with strings
  * installing truss rod, and glueing fret board to neck
  * fine shaping of neck
    * using the truss rod to level the neck flat 
    * adding compound radius to the fret board, so approximently 9in -> 16in from nut to body.
    * re-adjusting the truss rod after material removed
    * re-facing the back of the neck (which connects to the body) to create a slight pitch in the neck.
      * when the strings are attached the distance between a string a the frets will be larger towards the bridge
      * shorter towards the nut. This is so that when strings are plucked, the vibrating string will not hit the frets.
      * and cause an unwanted ringing. required because the amplitude of the vibrations will be larger towards the pickups, and smaller towards the nut or specific fret being held.
  * Most difficult step: fretting the fret board.
    * calculating the fret distances from the nut.
    * scribing all fret locations, then using a 0.025in kerf saw to cut slots in fret board
      * slots were made without a guide/jig so for exact cuts serious patience
    * Using soft mallet to carefully hammer the frets into the cut slots.
      * very nerve-racking due to the percision required. Wire choosen was also difficult to work with due to its thickness
      * some slots were not deep enough and the force used to insert some frets caused previous fret to become unset.
      * Loose fret were delt with using extermely small amounts of a two part epoxy mixed with wood dust from the fret board orgrinal stock
    * refining the installed frets with metal files, an alumium sanding block, and a leveling guide.
      * prior to this step the fret board was covered in a protective layer of pure tung oil and wax then taped. so that no shavings or dust would be able to penatrate the wood during this process
  * Final shaping of headstock.
  * Everything coated with finishing layers of pure tung oil and buffed with wax.
  * Installing electronics: pickups, switches, audio jack.
    * Soldering the curuit (currently no pre-amp, still needs fabrication)

## Tuning and Testing!

## Project Review

* Issues
  * Firstly, nothing impossible to fix!
  * **Bass**ically, only issues are with the fret board. 
    * the highest frets, specifically 19 and 21, have slightly flat notes. This is the result of a compounding errors due to my scribing method. My calpiers only have 12" range, so for scribing incrimental steps were made along with a fairly percise tape measure. But due to this these frets are off the proper mark by about 1/16th of an inch creating the flat notes.

* This was overall a great success! Even though I made a lot of mistakes, most were addressed in a creative and pragmatic way. Considering this was my first time building a guitar or something of this quality, I cant complain, and will most definently be revisiting this project to address my concerns.

## Future Ideas

* Redo the finish for a more protective coat. The final layer should probably be Gun Oil so that the guitar does not require any future coats to maintain a protective coat, like it does with pure tung oil.
* Potentially refretting the entire fret board. If necesisary, all the fret can be removed, and the fret board can be sanded flat again. If done I would build a jig for creating the frets due to the time and percision required last time. But hopefully just will refret the two problamatic frets. The method chosen will determine on how far the frets need to move and if the refretting will show imperfections.
* Creating a steeper pitch for the neck (re-facing the back of the neck). Sometimes if pluck very hard the strings with begin to ring. However for most situations the current pitch is perfect.
